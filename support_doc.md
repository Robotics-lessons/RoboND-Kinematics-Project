## Project: Kinematics Pick & Place

---

## Steps for submit the Kinematics Pick & Place project 

  Because the RoboND-Kinematics-Project project in github.com is under Robotics-lessons organizations group,
it is not in my popular repositorieds, I can't submit the github link url directly to Udacity project review.
I have to zip the folder and upload this zip file for reviewing.

 1. Go to project root
   cd  ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project

 2. Execute a zip command
   zip -r RoboND-Kinematics-Project.zip RoboND-Kinematics-Project

 3. Open a browser in VM
   Click browser icon in VM

 4. Open Udacity page for Robotics class to submit the project
   Use upload zip file option
